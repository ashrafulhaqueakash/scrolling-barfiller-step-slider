      If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
      When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next
      logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random
      Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose
      the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button.
      Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear. While it may not
      be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random
      paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this
      generator are listed in the following paragraphs. Creative Writing
      Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get
      their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no
      idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it appears. This
      forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common
      writing challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a
      short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random
      paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
      have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No
      matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced to
      use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing. Tackle
      Writers' Block A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a
      writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to
      being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete.
      By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can
      take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block
      in the first place. Beginning Writing Routine Another productive way to
      use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a
      random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still
      keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing
      started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects,
      words are already flowing from their fingers. Writing Challenge Another
      writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random
      paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph
      to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, the
      sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one
      another so it will be a bit different. You also won't know exactly how
      many sentences will appear in the random paragraph. Programmers It's not
      only writers who can benefit from this free online tool. If you're a
      programmer who's working on a project where blocks of text are needed,
      this tool can be a great way to get that. It's a good way to test your
      programming and that the tool being created is working well. Above are a
      few examples of how the random paragraph generator can be beneficial. The
      best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be useful for your
      intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of paragraphs to
      see if they are beneficial to your current project. If you do find this
      paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us know how you're
      using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the different ways this
      tool is being used so we can improve it with updates. This is especially
      true since there are times when the generators we create get used in
      completely unanticipated ways from when we initially created them. If you
      have the time, please send us a quick note on what you'd like to see
      changed or added to make it better in the future. Frequently Asked
      Questions Can I use these random paragraphs for my project? Yes! All of
      the random paragraphs in our generator are free to use for your projects.
      Does a computer generate these paragraphs? No! All of the paragraphs in
      the generator are written by humans, not computers. When first building
      this generator we thought about using computers to generate the
      paragraphs, but they weren't very good and many times didn't make any
      sense at all. We therefore took the time to create paragraphs specifically
      for this generator to make it the best that we could. Can I contribute
      random paragraphs? Yes. We're always interested in improving this
      generator and one of the best ways to do that is to add new and
      interesting paragraphs to the generator. If you'd like to contribute some
      random paragraphs, please contact us. How many words are there in a
      paragraph? There are usually about 200 words in a paragraph, but this can
      vary widely. Most paragraphs focus on a single idea that's expressed with
      an introductory sentence, then followed by two or more supporting
      sentences about the idea. A short paragraph may not reach even 50 words
      while long paragraphs can be over 400 words long, but generally speaking
      they tend to be approximately 200 words in length.
